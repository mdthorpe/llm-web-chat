Here are focused prompts to exercise different summary paths:

- First-sentence is great (should reuse it)
  - "Explain the difference between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in two paragraphs."

- Long, multi-sentence (should summarize)
  - "Write three paragraphs about the history, diet, and habitat of pandas."

- Dense first sentence (should accept as summary)
  - "Provide a concise overview of Kubernetes architecture, including control plane components and node agents, in two paragraphs."

- Markdown-heavy (heuristic strips markdown before speaking)
  - "Give an overview of HTTP/2 vs HTTP/3 with headings and bold terms."

- Contains code (heuristic should reject first sentence if it looks code-ish)
  - "Show me a React component that fetches data and explain it in two paragraphs."

- Contains a URL (heuristic should reject first sentence if it includes links)
  - "Summarize the key points from https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/ in two paragraphs."

- Short reply (should still summarize with min-sentences=1)
  - "Define idempotency in one sentence."

- Medical (like your example)
  - "What suture materials are most commonly used for internal and external closures? Please answer in two paragraphs."

Try these and watch:
- Summary appears above the assistant message.
- With your current settings, long/dense answers should reuse the first sentence; otherwise the LLM summary kicks in.
